  <p>A <b>basic part</b> is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. <a href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051">BBa_R0051</a> is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.</p>

  <p>Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are <b>many</b> opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. </p>
