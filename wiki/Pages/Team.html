Now I don't mean extra gills or something -- something we care about, like aging.”</p>

During this, she helped a little bit in the lab for various small experiments when extra hands were needed. In her spare time she enjoys exploring new places, eating new foods and learning about very bizarre diseases and viruses, and the various methods of how to treat them.</p>

                        <p class="description">This is Joyce's first year with iGEM and in university as a BioMed Eng. She is a part of the subteam which modelled and researched viral spread and plant defences. She enjoyed researching and poring over journal articles, as well as seeing ideas spring to life and building something from the ground up. Additionally, she was estatic at the opportunity to attempt to wrangle new programming languages for the sake of modelling things. In her spare time, she likes to draw and paint, contemplate the mysteries of the universe and play in orchestras.</p>

Her work for iGEM includes sifting through papers, helping pick out sgRNA targets, writing python scripts (while simultaneously figuring out how to python properly), and designing cas9 variants to be modelled in PyRosetta. Kim is also helping with the wiki design since she sold already sold her soul to web design for money. In her spare time she enjoys hanging out with dogs, biking places, cooking, eating dessert, and being facetious.</p>

Part of the Viral Assembly subgroup, she contributed an amalgamated preliminary viral network map and a large amount of research on plant defenses on the cellular level, in addition to modeling equations in SymBiology and helping out with the wiki, visuals for the final presentation and miscellaneous tasks along the way. She enjoys spending her time learning as much as she can about synthetic biology with a side of physics, design and coding.</p>

He's part of the Tridimensional Trifecta, and spent a lot of time trying to understand Cas9 structure, and getting PyRosetta/PyMOL set up on Windows. If he wasn't busy writing this bio he'd be looking into how to mutate Cas9 in PyRosetta as well. He helped with finding the different sgRNA targets, and also wrote a couple wiki pages. Puns cause him physical pain, though Tessa doesn't seem to mind. Because she's terrible. When not busy with iGEM he's working on his 499 project, because Lactobacillus is a cruel organism.</p>

                        <p class="description">This is Robert’s first year on iGEM, though he has been drifting towards mathematical biology throughout his entire degree. He investigated viral spread within plants, which involved tracking developments in this evolutionary arms race, fawning over the few papers that have explicit equations, and coding agent-based models. Unfortunately, his plot to include secret agents was against iGEM policy. In the rest of his life, he enjoys science comedy, classical music, reading a bit too intensely, and being aggressively interdisciplinary.</p>

She researched viral transport and plant defense mechanisms, which were infinitely more complex than she realised. Learning about python and agent-based modelling was confusing at first, and then kind of awesome. She hopes to help with western blotting and coordinating all the events. In other parts of her life, she enjoys playing clarinet, rock climbing, singing running, swing dancing, and listening to podcasts (helps her pretend she’s an adult). </p>
