        <p>Regardless of the topic, iGEM projects often create or adapt computational tools to move the project forward. Because they are born out of a direct practical need, these software tools (or new computational methods) can be surprisingly useful for other teams. Without necessarily being big or complex, they can make the crucial difference to a project's success. This award tries to find and honour such "nuggets" of computational work.</p>

        <p>If you are working on software as your main project, please join the software track. If you are creating software as an addition to your main project, please apply for this award.</p>

        <p>Here are a few examples from previous teams:</p>
