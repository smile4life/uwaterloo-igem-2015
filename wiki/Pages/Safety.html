  <h1>Safety in iGEM</h1>
  <p>Please visit <a href="http://2015.igem.org/Safety">the main Safety page</a> to find this year's safety requirements & deadlines, and to learn about safe & responsible research in iGEM.</p>

  <p>On this page of your wiki, you should write about how you are addressing any safety issues in your project. The wiki is a place where you can <strong>go beyond the questions on the safety forms</strong>, and write about whatever safety topics are most interesting in your project. (You do not need to copy your safety forms onto this wiki page.)</p>


  <h4>Safe Project Design</h4>
  <p>Does your project include any safety features? Have you made certain decisions about the design to reduce risks? Write about them here! For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Choosing a non-pathogenic chassis</li>
    <li>Choosing parts that will not harm humans / animals / plants</li>
    <li>Substituting safer materials for dangerous materials in a proof-of-concept experiment</li>
    <li>Including an "induced lethality" or "kill-switch" device</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Safe Lab Work</h4>
  <p>What safety procedures do you use every day in the lab? Did you perform any unusual experiments, or face any unusual safety issues? Write about them here!</p>

  <h4>Safe Shipment</h4>
  <p>Did you face any safety problems in sending your DNA parts to the Registry? How did you solve those problems?</p>
