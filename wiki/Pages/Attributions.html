            <h1>Attributions</h1>
            <p>
                Our project had many moving pieces, so there are many acknowledgments to give. From our large team, to our advisors, to graduate students in nearby labs, to some previous members on our team, a number of people contributed to this project and deserve recognition.
            </p>

                <dt>Project brainstorming</dt>

                <dt>General wet lab support</dt>
                <dd>Dr. Jiujun Cheng and graduate students Maya D'Alessio, John Heil, and Kathy Lam have given us very helpful advice, protocols, and access to pieces of equipment not available in our lab.</dd>
                <dt>Plant maintenance and tips</dt>
                <dd>Dr. Trevor Charles, Dr. Barbara Moffatt, and graduate students Cherry Chen, and Maye Saechao donated <i>Arabidopsis</i> seeds, helped with planting and maintenance, and gave us protocols for performing floral dips, agroinfiltration, and creating protoplasts. Dr. Simon Chuong, Dr. Susan Lolle, Dr. Pearl Chang also offered advice for floral dips and provided equipment and chemicals for Western blots.</dd>
                <dt>Viral infection advice</dt>
                <dd>Jamie McNeil, Dr. Aiming Wang, and a few other individuals at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada provided advice for infecting <i>Arabidopsis</i> with CaMV, and provided the resources and space to do so.</dd>
                <dt>Protein dynamics advice</dt>
                <dd>Dr. Andrew Doxey and Dr. Marc Aucoin were helpful resources for our sgRNA and Cas9 modifications, and offered advice on software to use and routes to pursue.</dd>
                <dt>Modeling support</dt>
                <dd>Dr. Brian Ingalls gave advice on all of our models and has been a very helpful resource, and gave some direction for the differential equation and agent-based models. Dr. Andrew Doxey gave advice on using (Py)Rosetta for protein modelling, and we had a couple helpful conversations with Dragos Chiriac from Queen's about PyRosetta and fold trees.</dd>
                <dt>Business support</dt>
                <dd>Lauren Kennedy, a friend of the team, and Pavel Shmatnik from the Toronto team have offered advice with our scale-up business model, and individuals from Canada Banana Farms and Agriculture Food Canada provided feedback on the plant application and direction.</dd>
                <dt>Finance support</dt>
                <dd>Suzie Alexander, the director of the 2014 Waterloo team, has given helpful financial and other administrative task advice.</dd>

            <div class="prevHighlightBox">
                <p> Each team must clearly attribute work done by the student team members on this page. The team must distinguish work done by the students from work done by others, including the host labs, advisors, instructors, and individuals not on the team roster. </p>


                <div class="highlightBox">
                    <h4> Can we base our project on a previous one? </h4>
                    <p>Yes! You can have a project based on a previous team, or based on someone else's idea, <b>as long as you state this fact very clearly and give credit for the original project.</b> </p>
                </div>



                <h4> Why is this page needed? </h4>
                <p>
                    The Attribution requirement helps the judges know what you did yourselves and what you had help with. We don't mind if you get help with difficult or complex techniques, but you must report what work your team did and what work was done by others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, you might choose to work with an animal model during your project. Working with animals requires getting a license and applying far in advance to conduct certain experiments in many countries. This is difficult to achieve during the course of a summer, but much easier if you can work with a postdoc or PI who has the right licenses.
                </p>
